# NOTE [Autograd interaction between torch.Tensor]
#
# The autograd functions defined below are being used by the public
# facing APIs (i.e. from_local, to_local) to ensure our DTensor
# works together with torch.Tensor within autograd engine. This
# allows DistributedTensor to exist on part of the module hierarchy
# and still able to calculate gradients across the torch.Tensor and
# DistributedTensor boundary.
# As an example, we have the a module that consists of submodules
# A, B, and C, the execution flow would be like:
#  input(torch.Tensor) -> Module A -> Module B -> Module C -> output (torch.Tensor)
#
# Suppose I only want to make Module B be a sharded module with
# DistributedTensor params, we would need to make the folloing
# flow to work:
#
#  input(torch.Tensor) -> Module A
#       -> DTensor input -> Sharded Module B -> DTensor output
#           -> output (torch.Tensor) -> Module C -> output (torch.Tensor)
#
# We need the conversion from Module A to DTensor input, which is
# `from_local`, and conversion from DTensor output to output, which
# is `to_local`, thus these two functions must be Autograd functions.
