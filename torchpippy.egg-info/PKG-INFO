The PiPPy project stands for Pipeline Parallelism for PyTorch. It consists of a
compiler and runtime stack for automated parallelism and scaling of PyTorch
models. PiPPy partitions the code of the model in a pipelined fashion and
enables multiple micro-batches to execute different parts of the model code
concurrently. For details, please visit PiPPy's [GitHub
page](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy).
